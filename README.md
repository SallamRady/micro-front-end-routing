# micro-front-end-routing
This project serves as a foundational setup for learning micro-frontend architecture, with a focus on implementing routing between individual micro-apps. Using React and Webpack, this app provides a minimal environment for experimenting with module federation, dynamic imports, and navigation patterns common in micro-frontend applications.
